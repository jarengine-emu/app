# Load Menu Documentation

The **Load** menu is your gateway to running MIDlet applications in JarEngine. This menu provides all the tools you need to load, manage, and organize your MIDlet collection.

## üìÅ Menu Items

### Load JAR
**Purpose**: Open and run MIDlet JAR files from your local file system.

**How to Use**:
1. Click **Load JAR** from the Load menu
2. Navigate to your MIDlet JAR file
3. Select the file and click Open
4. The MIDlet will load and start automatically

**Supported Formats**: Standard JAR files containing MIDlet applications

**Tips**:
- Make sure your JAR file contains valid MIDlet classes
- Large JAR files may take a moment to load
- Check the console for any loading errors

### Fetch via URL
**Purpose**: Download and run MIDlets directly from web URLs.

**How to Use**:
1. Click **Fetch via URL** from the Load menu
2. Enter the complete URL to your MIDlet JAR file
3. Click OK to start the download
4. The MIDlet will automatically load once downloaded

**Supported URLs**: HTTP and HTTPS URLs pointing to JAR files

**Tips**:
- Ensure the URL points directly to a JAR file
- Check your internet connection before downloading
- Some servers may require authentication

### Terminate
**Purpose**: Stop the currently running MIDlet application.

**Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+W`

**How to Use**:
1. Click **Terminate** from the Load menu
2. Or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+W`
3. The current MIDlet will stop and return to the main interface

**When to Use**:
- When a MIDlet becomes unresponsive
- To stop a running application before loading another
- To free up system resources

### Recents Library
**Purpose**: Quick access to recently opened MIDlet applications.

**Features**:
- **Smart Organization**: Automatically tracks your recently used MIDlets
- **Visual Icons**: Shows MIDlet icons when available
- **Suite Names**: Displays friendly names instead of file paths
- **Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicates

**How to Use**:
1. Hover over **Recents Library** in the Load menu
2. Select any previously opened MIDlet from the list
3. The MIDlet will load immediately

**Benefits**:
- Faster access to frequently used applications
- No need to navigate through file dialogs
- Maintains your MIDlet usage history

### Exit
**Purpose**: Close the JarEngine application completely.

**Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Q`

**How to Use**:
1. Click **Exit** from the Load menu
2. Or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Q`
3. Confirm if you have unsaved work

**Note**: This will close all running MIDlets and the application. Make sure to save any important work before exiting.

## üîß Advanced Features

### Automatic MIDlet Detection
JarEngine automatically detects and validates MIDlet files, ensuring only compatible applications are loaded.

### Error Handling
The Load menu provides clear error messages for:
- Invalid JAR files
- Missing MIDlet classes
- Network download failures
- File permission issues

### Memory Management
- Automatically manages memory when loading multiple MIDlets
- Provides feedback on system resource usage
- Optimizes loading for large applications

## üöÄ Best Practices

1. **Organize Your MIDlets**: Keep your JAR files in a dedicated folder for easy access
2. **Use Recents**: Take advantage of the Recents Library for frequently used applications
3. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure your JAR files are compatible with the MIDP version you're targeting
4. **Monitor Resources**: Use the Terminate option to free up resources when needed

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Problem**: JAR file won't load
- **Solution**: Check if the file is corrupted or incomplete
- **Solution**: Verify the JAR contains valid MIDlet classes
